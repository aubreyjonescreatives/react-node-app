## There are not many commits here because I had to move files around on my computer 

## This Card Deck API does not require an api key 

## You will need to change the CRUD paths to access your localhost if you do not connect this to a database 

## If you do not connect to a database or node.js, I recommend adding in a PORT .env variable to a .env file and then adding ${PORT} to your localhost path

## I am still working on overall functionality so that I can deploy this app while combining back end to front end
